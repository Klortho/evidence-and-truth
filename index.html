And you may.<br />
Try them and<br />
You may I say.</p>

Will let me be,<br />
I will try them,<br />
And you will see.</p>

<p>I would want them<br />
With Aunt Ruth.<br />
I would like them<br />
With vermouth.</p>
<p>I would want them<br />
Now and then.<br />
I would have them<br />
Anywhen!</p>
<p>They are good,<br />
So good you see.<br />
Evidence and truth<br />
Have set me free!</p>
